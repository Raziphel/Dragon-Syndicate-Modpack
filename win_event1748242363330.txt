Detected that Windows has terminated one or more processes within the last minute leading up to the moment of the current Minecraft JVM instance termination,
so with a very high probability that one of these processes is the Minecraft JVM itself.
Command used to identify terminated processes:
 
$ErrorActionPreference = 'Continue'; 
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ 
  LogName='Application'; 
  Level=2; 
  StartTime=(Get-Date).AddMinutes(-1) 
} *>&1 | Format-Table -Wrap -AutoSize | Out-File "win_event1748242363330.txt" -Encoding UTF8
 
If no java.exe (or related JVM processes) are listed below, you can disregard this message.
To get more information about such errors:
1) Open Windows Event Viewer (Win+R -> eventvwr.msc -> Enter).
2) Click "Windows Logs" -> "Application".
3) Look for the latest Error you have.
